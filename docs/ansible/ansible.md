    ## What is Ansible?

    Ansible® is an open source, command-line IT automation software application written in Python. 

    It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate advanced workflows to support application deployment, system updates, and more.

    Ansible’s main strengths are simplicity and ease of use. 

    It also has a strong focus on security and reliability, featuring minimal moving parts. 

    It uses OpenSSH for transport (with other transports and pull modes as alternatives), and uses a human-readable language that is designed for getting started quickly without a lot of training.
