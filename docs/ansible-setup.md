# Setup/Install Ansible

!!! info

    *This is how I automated the deployment of a test environment, with 2 Windows Servers VMs as DC controllers and 3 Windows 10 VMs as client. All 3 clients have been sign into the Windows AD, and so have both the Windows Servers.*

    *This was made for and deployed onto a Proxmox Server with ansible running on a Ubuntu VM from my Windows laptop as controller.*

## Installation on Ubuntu VM

--------------------

!!! example "Install sudo"

    ### Install sudo
    This will be needed later for sudo nano.
    ```
    apt-get install sudo

    ```
    Or
    ```
    sudo apt-get install curl
    ```

## Prep Proxmox Server

!!! example "Install Proxmoxer"

    ### Install Proxmoxer
    This will be needed to deploy VMs via Ansible on the Proxmox server.
    This has to be done on the Proxmox server ifself.
    ```

    ```
    pip install requests
    ```
    ```
    pip install paramiko

    (Do this to both Proxmox Server and Ubuntu VM)
    ```

    ```


--------------------

## Configuration of Ansible controller

![ansible-ssh](img/Ansible-ssh.png)

!!! example "Modify Hosts"

    ### Modify Hosts
    After installing Ansible, the file /etc/hosts file is created automatically. 
    In this file, we are required to add our managed nodes.

    In the file, add your managed nodes as below.

    ```
    [Node1]
    192.168.100.118
    [Node2]
    192.168.100.119
    ```

---------------------

!!! example "Modify Ansible.cfg"

    ### Modify Ansible.cfg 
    Find and change the following settings in 
    ```
    sudo nano /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
    ```
    ```
    inventory = /etc/ansible/hosts

    forks = 5
    sudo_user = root

    remote_user = root

    become=True
    become_method=sudo
    become_user=root
    become_ask_pass=False
    ```

---------------------

!!! example "Allow root login"

    ### Allow root login
    (login to all nodes and do the following)

    To enable SSH login for a root user on Debian Linux system you need to first configure SSH server. 
    ```
    sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    ```

    Change the following line:
    ```
    FROM:
    PermitRootLogin without-password
    
    TO:
    PermitRootLogin yes
    ```

    Once you made the above change restart your SSH server:
    ```
    # /etc/init.d/ssh restart
    [ ok ] Restarting ssh (via systemctl): ssh.service.
    ```

--------------------

!!! example "Push SSH key to nodes"

    ### Push SSH key to nodes
    This is done so that Ansible can use the SSH key to sign in as a user
    ```
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub your_username@192.168.100.118
    ```
